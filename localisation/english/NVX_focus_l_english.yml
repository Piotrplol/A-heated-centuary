This is especially so in China, as the recent growth in the economy has allowed thousands of nameless ministers to illegally enrich themselves with profits that should be going to the Party. Of course, while we are going about arresting the men skimming of the top, we can make a big public campaign about it. The people will think more money will be spent on them now, and that should keep them happy."
 PRC_industrial_safety:0 "Industrial Safety Laws"
 PRC_industrial_safety_desc:0 "What allowed us to become the modern workshop of the world was allowing our people to work in brutal conditions no western nation would accept, and all for virtually no pay. As much as the more benevolent men within the Party might want to change this, doing so would weaken China’s position as a rising superpower. Still, we can offer minor concessions and make sure people know all about what the government is doing to protect them. That should calm down any thoughts of protesting their conditions."

Our schools tend to be underfunded and undermanned, cheating is rampant, and our constant demands for political indoctrination seem to be getting in the way of proper learning.

Several would be businessmen, no doubt influenced by outside ideas, have presented the government with a brand new reformed system for our control of the economy. Basically, we will allow quasi free market economic actions to take place inside the country, but the government will retain total authority in any exchange involving a foreign party.

South Africa itself probably would like it too."
 PRC_south_african_development:0 "South African Development"
 PRC_south_african_development_desc:0 "We set up some symbolic operations that will help our partners on their day to day running of their countries, but we need to do more to secure their loyalty.

 DEN_Karup_air_base_desc:0 "Karup in Jutland is home to our largest Air Base, not only the largest in Denmark but the largest in all of Northern Europe. As the pride and joy of our Air Force it reinforces the fact that even though we're a geographically small nation we're more than capable of punching above our weight class. Karup needs to be protected, to be respected - and perhaps even to be expanded."
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production:0 "Streamline the Aircraft Production"
 DEN_streamline_aircraft_production_desc:0 "Several of our advisors have recommended that we bring the production of aircrafts for the Air Force home.

 DEN_mobilize_frogmen_desc:0 "The Frogmen Corps, or in Danish 'Frømandskorpset', is our maritime special operations force. The Frogmen Corps has extremely exclusive selection training, as seen in the fact that since the Corps was founded in 1957 there has only been a little more than 300 Frogmen - in total.

 DEN_empower_regions:0 "Empower the Regions"
 DEN_empower_regions_desc:0 "Some of our advisors have suggested that the problem with the amts was that they weren't large enough to be of any real use. Instead we should create a new system of a few administrative Danish 'regions' each spanning a large part of Denmark. This would ensure greater focus on large cities as funding isn't swallowed by minor, irrelevant outskirts."
 DEN_natural_gas_deposits:0 "Natural Gas Deposits"
 DEN_natural_gas_deposits_desc:0 "The North Sea is a treasure trove of natural resources. Chief among these are the large deposits of natural gas - if we can renovate the high pressure transmission lines connecting to them it would take some of the pressure off the rest of our energy sources."

 DEN_revitalize_the_outskirts_desc:0 "A large number of municipalities are struggling to maintain their population as more and more people move to the big cities, and have asked for our help.
